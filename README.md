# gov-app

A simple quiz on the Israel-Palestine conflict, that me and some friends made for an AP United States Government and Politics class. The quiz says where you are on the spectrum, and whether you believe the United States should support Israel or Palestine.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app (but you probably won't since it's just used in class for a demo):

```bash
npm run build
```
